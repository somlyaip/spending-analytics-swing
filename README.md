# Spending Analytics Swing

Pet project to try out classic (non web based) MVC.
Especially as a [compound pattern](https://medium.com/@charithavenkataraju/model-view-controller-mvc-ba6c07dff565).
I found this theory in the book Head First: Design Patterns
and I have to try it.

Application's goal is to show chart based bank account transaction history 
grouped by vendor types (like Revolut).
